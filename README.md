# Documentation for Next.js Bootstrap sections and components

In order to speedup the development process of landing pages we are making a collection of the components may require for landing pages or static pages. In repo we will store our code and document it for future use and will update it as requires.

## How to use

1. Clone the repository to the local device.
2. Run

```(shell)
git remote add origin https://github.com/USER/REPO>.git
git push origin main
```

3. Run `npm install`, and `npm run dev` in your local machine.
4. See the file `./pages/index.js` to check all the pre build code/section.
5. Change the static props data as needed and delete all the un necessary files from `./views/...`.
